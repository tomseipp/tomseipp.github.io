I am an adventure bikepacker studying mechanical engineering at the Univerity of Sheffield. I have a keen interest in the aspects of engineering that have a direct link to the real world such as machining, design and manufacturing techniques. I am always looking for ways to link my studies with my personal passions and hobbies so I have joined a student led project which aims to design and manufacture a downhill racing bike, I also make use of the university's machine shop for personal projects.

In and out of competition, cycling has always been a major part of my life. I have done various races and challenges ranging from the 24 hour mountain biking national championship, to the 2750 mile tour divide mountain bike route. Growing up with bikes is what has given me a passion for mechanical engineering and I hope to use it as a driving factor in my career forwards.
