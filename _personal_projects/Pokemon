  <h2>
    Project Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
    Pok√©mon was one of may favorite games to play when I was younger, and was one of thoughts for one of my first python projects!
    This game has been a continual process of improvement and learning from the start: I didn't even know what a class was at the 
    beginning. Over time I have improved the graphics and gameplay considerably, and despite not having much time to update it anymore,
    it will always be fun to play for me!
